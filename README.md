# Compact Mode

This is a plugin for SiYuan Notes that can adjust line height or block spacing.

If you have any questions, you can raise an issue

<!-- - Customize `line-height` within a block
- Customize the `gap` between blocks
- Set all blocks' `padding` and `margin` to `0` by default

> Note: If you set the adjustment value too large or too small, it may cause abnormal misalignment of complex block layouts such as lists -->
